# Discord Invite Bruteforcer

a node.js script that randomly generates discord invite links and checks if they're valid or not.

## Side-note
the odds of actually finding a working invite link are pretty damn low. if you genuinely manage to find anything valid with this (or just wanna reach out), my discord is `dootw`



## Prerequisites

- nodejs, you can get it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

first, clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/dootss/discord-invite-bruteforcer
```

### Windows

double-click on the `installer.bat` file in the project folder to install the required dependencies

### macOS/Linux

open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```
chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh
```

this will make the `installer.sh` script executable and run it to install the required dependencies

## Running the Script

### Windows

double-click on the `run.bat` file in the project folder to run the checker

### macOS/Linux

open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

this will make the `run.sh` script executable and run it to start the checker
