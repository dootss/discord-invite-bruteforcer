# Discord Invite Bruteforcer

a node.js script that randomly generates discord invite links and checks if they're valid or not.

## Side-note
the odds of actually finding a working invite link are pretty damn low. if you genuinely manage to find anything valid with this (or just wanna reach out), my discord is `dootw`
